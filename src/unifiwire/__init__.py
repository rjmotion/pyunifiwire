"""The wire UniFi cameras and controllers speak to each other.

One protocol, two ends. This package is the part that is identical whichever end
you are writing: the message envelope, the WebSocket framing, the `extendedFlv`
container, the HEVC bitstream, and the AMF0 metadata that identifies a stream.

    from unifiwire import envelope, flv, hevc, ws

Nothing here decides policy. There is no notion of adoption, of settings, or of
what a camera should do when asked to move — those belong to whichever end you are
building. What is here is what the bytes mean, and every value in it was measured
against a real UniFi Protect controller and a real UVC G5 PTZ rather than guessed.

See `SPEC.md` for the format itself, written out.
